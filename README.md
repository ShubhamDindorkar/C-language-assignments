# C-language-assignments
This repository contains all my C programming assignments completed during my academic journey.
The assignments cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax and control structures to more advanced concepts such as data structures and algorithms. Each assignment is contained in a separate folder with relevant code files, input/output examples, and sometimes brief explanations.

# Introduction
This repository showcases my progress in learning C programming. Each assignment is intended to address different aspects of the language and its features. The purpose of this collection is to demonstrate my understanding of C concepts through hands-on coding exercises.

Feel free to explore the repository and learn from the code! If you find any bugs or improvements, contributions are welcome.
